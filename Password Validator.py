1. At least 1 letter between [a-z]
2. At least 1 number between [0-9]
3. At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
4. At least 1 character from [$#@]
5. Minimum length of transaction password: 6
6. Maximum length of transaction password: 12
Your program should accept a sequence of comma separated passwords and will check them according to the above criteria. Passwords that match the criteria are to be printed, each separated by a comma.
Example:
If the following passwords are given as input to the program:
ABd1234@1,a F1#,2w3E*,2We3345
Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
