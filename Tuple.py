# Tuples basic functionality is as same as a LIST.
# The main diiference is TUPLE is immutable. Which means it can't be modified or changed.
# Once a tuple is created, it's created forever.
# Tuples initialized with parenthesis "()"


# Initializing a TUPLE
coordinates = (7,5)
print(coordinates)
print(coordinates[0]) # prints 7 as it's in index 0

# LIST of TUPLEs
name_id = [("Jodu", 12), ("Kodu", 17), ("Ludu", 23)]
print(name_id) # prints the list of tuples
print(name_id[0]) # prints ('Jodu', 12)
